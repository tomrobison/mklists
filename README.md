Tweaks folders of plain-text lists to match evolving content rules

2012-12-26. This will be a completely new reimplementation of the script
previously known as shuffle (1994), shawkle (2006), shawkle.py (2011),
originally planned as a project to incrementally improve shawkle.py under the
name listmunger.

Wish list:

* Unit tests (most of the code is about testing data integrity anyway) - will start with these
* Configuration files in YAML
* Default configuration file generated when program first run
* Per-directory configuration not just of rules, but of all options (over-rideable with command-line switches)
* Object-oriented design (overkill?)
* Python distribution package

Tag line - which one conveys the idea best?

* Tweaks folders of plain-text lists as you edit your evolving rules
* Rearranges folders of plain-text lists according to your evolving rules
* Refreshes folders of plain-text lists to match your evolving rules
* Synchs folders of plain-text lists to match your evolving rules
* Tweaks folders of plain-text lists in synch with evolving content rules
